### The Manuscripts of Isaiah Discovered in the Judaean Desert of Jordan

Several manuscripts of Isaiah were discovered in the Jordan Desert. One of the first scrolls to be studied was the so-called Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa<sup>a</sup>). The manuscript of 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> is a complete scroll with relatively little damage to the scroll. In addition to 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>, there were several other Isaiah manuscripts discovered at Qumran and at Masada.
